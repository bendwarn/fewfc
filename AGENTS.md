# Agent Instructions

## Development Environment Tips

- This repository is a Rust crate. Prefer `cargo test` for the main validation path unless the task specifically touches package tooling.

## Agent Skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked as local markdown files under `docs/local-issues/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the default five-role triage vocabulary unless a local issue explicitly says otherwise. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context rules-engine repo; read `CONTEXT.md` and relevant decision docs before domain-sensitive work. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
